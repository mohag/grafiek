Format of scripts
-----------------

All scripts are plain-text files starting with the following line:
GRAPHSCRIPT

Items on [] is optional

The rest of the lines can start with one of the following characters:
 C to set the color of the graph
  Format: C <number of color> e.g. C 12

 D to set the detail of the graph
  Format: D <detail> e.g. D 50

 L to enable/disable linemode
  Format: L <"1" to enable, "0" to disable or "T" to toggle> e.g. L 1

 S to set the scale of the graph.
  Format: S <Scale> e.g. S 15

 X to set position of X-axis.
  Format X <Position of X-axis in pixels from the top or C for center of screen> e.g. X 239

 Y to set position of Y-axis.
  Format Y <Position of Y-axis in pixels from left or C for center of screen> e.g. Y 319

 CLS to clear the screen
  e.g. CLS

 P to plot a graph
  Format: P <equation of graph>[|<minimum value>|<maximum value>] e.g. P 2x+3|-2|5/2

 ; for comment.  Must be at start of line.
  e.g. ;Set color to green

Example of script:
------------------
GRAPHSCRIPT
;This script plots a red heart to the screen
C 12
;Set color of graph to red
X C
Y C
;Set X- and Y-axis to center of screen
S 15
;Set scale to 15
D 15
;Detail to 15
L 1
;Linemode ON
CLS
;Clears screen
P sqrt(100-x^2)+abs(x)|-10|10
; Equation is "sqrt(100-x^2)+abs(x)" minimum value in domain in -10 max value in domain is 10
P -sqrt(100-x^2)+abs(x)|-10|10
;Plots the heart
