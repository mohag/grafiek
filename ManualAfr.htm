<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>1. Gaan in Windows Explorer in deur na&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Windows 95 - ME:</b> Start &gt; Programs &gt; Windows Explorer</p>
<p><b>Windows XP: </b>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Windows
Explorer</p>
<p><b>Alle weergawes van Windows na 95:</b> Hou die <font SIZE="4" face="Wingdings">ÿ</font>-knoppie
in, druk E.</p>
<p>2. Gaan na folder waar die program geïnstaleer is.</p>
<p>3. Double click op &quot;grafiek&quot; (grafiek.exe as rekenaar gestel is om
&quot;extensions&quot; te wys) met reghoekige icon van 'n &quot;window.&quot;</p>
<p>4. U kan 'n &quot;shortcut&quot; na die program skep deur, in die meer
onlangse weergawes van windows, daarop te regter click en te sê Sent to &gt;
Desktop (Create Shortcut).</p>
<h3><a name="menusystem"></a>Menu stelsel</h3>
<p>Alle menus in hierdie program werk as volg:</p>

<p>Om by 'n spesifieke opsie in te gaan, druk die karakter wat voor die opsie
verskyn. Bv. Druk 1 by die &quot;Main Menu&quot; om die grafiekskerm skoon te
maak.</p>

<p>Om terug te gaan vanaf enige menu druk die Esc knoppie.</p>

<p>Regs op die skerm by die Main Menu en die verstellings menu word 'n kort
opsomming van die huidige verstellings gewys.</p>

<h4><a name="menuoptions"></a>Menu opsies</h4>

<h5>0 Wys Skerm</h5>

<p>Hierdie opsie wys alle grafieke wat geplot is sedert die skerm skoongemaak
is.&nbsp; Grafieke word nie outomaties gewys nadat dit geplot is nie.</p>

<h5><a name="custom"></a>A Custom vergelyking</h5>

<p>Dit word gebruik om 'n grafiek van 'n ander tipe as die vooraf bepaalde
opsies (2-4) te plot.&nbsp; Dit word beïnvloed deur die verstellings vir detail
en linemode. 'n Verduideliking van hierdie verstellings volg onder die hulp vir
die verstellings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indien hierdie opsie gekies word lyk die skerm soos volg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0">Lees asb. die afdeling oor die <a href="#settings">verstellings</a>

<p>Hierdie funksie kan lank neem om 'n grafiek te plot as die <a href="#detail">detail</a>
hoog gestel is en u rekenaar taamlik stadig is.&nbsp; Indien u wil weet hoe ver
die grafiek geplot is, kyk heel onder op die skerm.&nbsp; Daar is 'n klein rooi
kolletjie(pixel) wat van beweeg om aan te dui hoe ver die grafiek geplot is.&nbsp; Dit
vertikaal in lyn met die deel van die grafiek wat op die oomblik berken
word.&nbsp; Hierdie program gaan voort om die waardes te bereken selfs al is dit
nie op die skerm nie.&nbsp; Hierdie program bereken eers vanaf die Y-as na regs
en daarna vanaf die Y-as na links.</p>
<p>Desimale kommas word omgeskakel na desimale punte.&nbsp; Blokhakies ([]) word
na gewone (()) hakies verander.</p>
<p>Om 'n minus te gebruik net om aan te dui dat 'n getal negatief is word nie
toegelaat nie.&nbsp; Vervang bv. (-3x +5) met (0-3x+5).&nbsp; (x+2)^2-5 sal
egter reg werk.</p>
<h5>2 tot 4 Reguitlyn, parabool, hiperbool</h5>
<p>Hierdie opsies is heelwat vinniger as opsie A om die bogenoemde grafieke te
plot.&nbsp; Dit is egter nie so buigbaar soos <a href="#custom">custom
vergelyking</a> nie.</p>
<p>Indien u hierdie opsies kies, wys die program 'n algemene vergelyking vir die
gekose tipe grafiek en vra vir waardes vir al die veranderlikes.</p>
<p>Alle veranderlikes is reële getalle.&nbsp; Indien u 'n ongeldige waarde
intik (bv. iets wat 'n letter bevat) sal die program staak en u sal alle
getekende grafieke verloor.</p>

<h3><a name="skaal"></a>5 Stel skaal van grafiek</h3>
<p>Hierdie verstelling verstel die skaal van die grafiek.&nbsp; Die skaal is in
pixels per eenheid.&nbsp; As die skaal bv. 15 is is een 15 pixels regs van die
Y-as, ens.</p>
<p>'n Groter waarde hiervoor veroorsaak dus dat die blokkies op die grafiek
groter is.</p>
<h3><a name="color"></a>6 Stel die kleur van die grafiek</h3>
<p>Hierdie opsie word gebruik om die kleur van die grafiek te verstel.&nbsp;
Sodra u hier ingaan word 'n lys van kleure tesame met hul kodes gewys.&nbsp; Tik
net die kode van die kleur wat u wil hê in.</p>
<h3><a name="detail"></a>7 Stel detail van die grafiek</h3>
<p>Hierdie verstelling is slegs van toepassing op &quot;custom vergelyking&quot;
grafieke.</p>
<p>Hierdie is die verstelling wat die grootste invloed op die spoed van die
program het.</p>
<p>Dit bepaal die hoeveelheid y-waardes wat vir elke pixel op die X-as bereken
word.&nbsp; In die default video mode is daar 640 pixels op die X-as.&nbsp; Daar
word dus 640*detail pixels bereken.&nbsp; Indien die detail op sy default
verstelling van 50 is word daar dus 640*500 = 32 000 waardes bereken. Die
metode wat gebruik word om dit te bereken is egter nie baie effektief nie.</p>
<p>Op detail 500 het dit weergawe 0.99a ongeveer 9,5 sekondes geneem om tan(x) te plot op
'n 1.67GHz <a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD</a> Athlon XP 2000+ met Windows XP
op.&nbsp; Op 'n 486 40Mhz met DOS het dit egter 6 minute 40 sekondes geneem om
dieselfde grafiek te plot.&nbsp; Dit is dus noodsaaklik om die regte verstelling
vir u rekenaar te kry.</p>
<p>Weergawe 1.0 is heelwat vinniger en neem slegs 2 minute 2 sekondes om tan(x)
op dieselfde 40MHz 486 laptop te plot.</p>
<p>Indien die detail egter te laag is sal die grafiek nie 'n ononderbroke lyn
wees nie.&nbsp; Om hierdie verskynsel teë te werk is daar linemode (sien <a href="#linemode">onder</a>
vir beskrywing.)</p>
<p>Indien <a href="#linemode">linemode</a> aan is word dit aanbeveel dat die
detail verlaag word na iets tussen 1 en 50.</p>
<h3><a name="linemode"></a>8 Enable/Disable linemode</h3>
<p>Hierdie verstelling is slegs van toepassing op die &quot;<a href="#custom">custom
vergelyking</a>&quot; grafieke.</p>
<p>Hierdie opsie word gebruik om linemode aan of af te skakel.&nbsp; Indien u
hier ingaan word u gevra of u linemode wil aan of af skakel.&nbsp; Druk slegs J
of Y vir Ja of N vir Nee.</p>
<p>Indien linemode aangeskakel is word daar nog steeds detail waardes vir y vir
elke pixel op die X-as bereken, daar word egter 'n lyn getrek van een pixel na
die volgende.&nbsp; Sodoende kan 'n mooi grafiek maklik verkry word sonder om te
lank te wag.&nbsp; Indien linemode aangeskakel word, word dit aanbeveel dat die <a href="#detail">detail</a>
afgestel word.</p>
<p>Dit word aanbeveel dat linemode ten alle tye aangeskakel bly.</p>
<h3><a name="Advanced"></a>Gevorderde verstellings</h3>
<p>Hierdie verstellings verskyn nie op die menu nie.</p>
<h4>Path na BGI files</h4>
<p>Hierdie program gebruik BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) graphics
drivers.&nbsp; BGI drivers word saam met verkeie Borland DOS programerings tale
verprei.&nbsp; Die BGI files behoort by hierdie program ingesluit te wees.&nbsp;
Indien dit nie ingesluit is nie, download dit <a href="http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/horizon/2942/graph.zip">hier</a>,
as die link links nie werk nie email my <a href="mailto:gertvdb@global.co.za">hier</a>.</p>
<p>Die default verstelling is om die BGI file (VGA Driver) wat in die program se
EXE ingesluit is te gebruik (1.0 en nuwer). 'n VESA driver wat resolutions van
tot 1280x1024 support. Hierdie verstelling is
slegs beskikbaar indien die program nie 'n BGI file in die verstelling se
directory kry nie.</p>
<h4>Graphics driver en mode</h4>
<p>Indien Grafiek vanaf die MS-DOS prompt gerun word met die command-line
parameter /G word, kan die graphics driver en video mode gekies word.</p>

<p>Druk 0 vir die VESA driver (support tot 1280x1024 maar werk nie altyd reg met
Windows XP nie) of 9 vir die default VGA driver.&nbsp; Kies daarna 'n
resolution.&nbsp; Hierdie program is getoets in 640x480 met die VGA driver.
Indien u probleme het met die VESA driver gebruik die VGA driver teen 640x480.</p>

<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
<pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
<h4>Preamble</h4>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.</p>
<h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4>
<p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
    notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or
    publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
    any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands
    interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that
    there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
    users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
    user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
    is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
    based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
</ul>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Program.
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.
<p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
    physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy
    of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to
    the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)</li>
</ul>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
<p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.
<p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.
<p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.
<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<p>&nbsp;
<h4>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
<h4>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><var>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands <samp>`show w'</samp> and <samp>`show c'</samp>
should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <samp>`show w'</samp> and <samp>`show
c'</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.</p>

<h3><a name="fdl"></a>GNU Free Documentation License</h3>
<p>Version 1.2, November 2002
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
<p><strong>0. PREAMBLE</strong>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
<p>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.
<p><strong>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</strong>
<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free
license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You
accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
permission under copyright law.
<p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.
<p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers
or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
<p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
<p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
<p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text
editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image
format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF
designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include
PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read
and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.
<p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not
have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most
prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of
the text.
<p>A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific
section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To
&quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this
definition.
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
<p><strong>2. VERBATIM COPYING</strong>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.
<p><strong>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</strong>
<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must
present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
other respects.
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with
each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
location from which the general network-using public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
<p><strong>4. MODIFICATIONS</strong>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role
of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things
in the Modified Version:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><strong>A.</strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
    title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
    original publisher of that version gives permission.
  <li><strong>B.</strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
    persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
    the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
    unless they release you from this requirement.
  <li><strong>C.</strong> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of
    the Modified Version, as the publisher.
  <li><strong>D.</strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
  <li><strong>E.</strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
    modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
  <li><strong>F.</strong> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
    license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
    under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
  <li><strong>G.</strong> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
    Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
    notice.
  <li><strong>H.</strong> Include an unaltered copy of this License.
  <li><strong>I.</strong> Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;,
    Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year,
    new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
    Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document,
    create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document
    as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version
    as stated in the previous sentence.
  <li><strong>J.</strong> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
    Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
    likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
    it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You
    may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
    years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
    version it refers to gives permission.
  <li><strong>K.</strong> For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;
    or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve
    in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
    acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
  <li><strong>L.</strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
    unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
    equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
  <li><strong>M.</strong> Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.
    Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
  <li><strong>N.</strong> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
  <li><strong>O.</strong> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.
<p>You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting
on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.
<p><strong>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</strong>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
their Warranty Disclaimers.
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
&quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section
Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.
You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;
<p><strong>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</strong>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into
the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding
verbatim copying of that document.
<p><strong>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</strong>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the
compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the
Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the
Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
that bracket the whole aggregate.
<p><strong>8. TRANSLATION</strong>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and
any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English
version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original
version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to
Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
<p><strong>9. TERMINATION</strong>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<p><strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</strong>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or
any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version
that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
<p>&nbsp;
<h4>How to use this License for your documents</h4>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
	 Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
      Free Documentation License&quot;.
</pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination
of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.</p>
